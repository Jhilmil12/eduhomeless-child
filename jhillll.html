<p1>=> treet children are poor or homeless children who live on the streets of a city, town, or village. Homeless youth are often called street kids, or urchins; the definition of street children is contested, but many practitioners and policymakers use UNICEF's concept of boys and girls, aged under 18 years, for whom "the street" (including unoccupied dwellings and wasteland) has become home and/or their source of livelihood, and who are inadequately protected or supervised.<br> Street girls are sometimes called gamines,<br>a term that is also used for Colombian street children of either sex.<br>

	Some street children, notably in more developed nations, are part of a subcategory called thrown-away children, consisting of children who have been forced to leave home. Thrown-away children are more likely to come from single-parent homes.<br>Street children are often subject to abuse, neglect, exploitation, or, in extreme cases, murder by "clean-up squads" that have been hired by local businesses or police.<br>the coll.</p1><br><br><br>

<h5><a href="file:///D:/placement%20.html"><i><b>how to help homeless child<b></i></a></h5>
<p>In September of 2007 Jon Linton began gathering imagery to document the homeless on the streets of Phoenix Arizona. <br>That Fall he had volunteered both time and resources at a local homeless shelter to better understand the circumstance and plight of those without a place to call home.<br> His project took shape, when the first man he photographed wept as he asked him his name.<br> “You have no idea how long it has been since someone cared to ask my name”, he stated.<br>
	Through the course of this journey Jon has met many souls that through a bad set of circumstances, addiction or mental illness find themselves without a door to walk through at day’s end. They had fallen into what some had referred to as an “Invisible World".<br> The I Have a Name Project is a humble attempt to bring dignity and humanity to those less fortunate among us.
	
	Jon encourages you to go out and help another in need. <br>He says your soul will thank you and reminds you to always practice compassion with these 10 tips that will help you better understand how you can help someone on the street.<br>
